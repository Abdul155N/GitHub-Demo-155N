# CSCE 155N Git Demo Repository

This repository was developed as supplemental material for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's CSCE 155N course. The topics covered in the walkthrough wiki are specific to using Matlab in GitHub but can be applied to other types of projects as well.

If you are in the CSCE 155N course and would like to use this repository to practice using GitHub, email me directly with your GitHub information and I will add you to the repository. You are able to complete the walkthrough using your own repository should you wish to do so.
